This is a vulnerable web app for a SUGUS talk. You should not copy-paste this app, because it has serious easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities.

## Windows Users
We recommend you to have installed npm, but the script should still work.
Just run `.\run.ps1` on a priviledged PowerShell, and it will start all the environment.

## Linux Users
Just run `./run.sh` with super user priviledges (_sudo_), and it will start all the environment.
